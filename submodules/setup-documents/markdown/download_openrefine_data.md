The Portal Project Teaching Dataset is a real dataset that has been used in over 100 publications. We have simplified it
for the purposes of this lesson, but you can download the full dataset (see below for details) and work with it
using exactly the same tools we will learn here.

For this lesson, you will need to download the following file (remember where you downloaded the file!):
*  [portal_project_rodents.csv](data/portal_project_rodents.csv)

Data in some of the columns of the above file (e.g. `geolocation`, `locality`, `county`, `country`, `JSON`) are contrived for the purpose of the lessons and are in no way related to the original dataset.
