## Introduction to the Data for this Lesson ##
The data used in this lesson comes from a project observing a small mammal community in southern
Arizona, US. This is part of a project studying the effects of rodents and ants on the plant
community that has been running for almost 40 years. The rodents are sampled on a series of 24 plots,
with different experimental manipulations controlling which rodents are allowed to access which plots.
This is a real dataset that has been used in over 100 publications. It is published at [Ecological Archives](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/118/) and can be found on [Portal Project Database](https://github.com/weecology/PortalData). This data is open and free to use for research purposes.

> ## For Interest Only: Portal Project Teaching Dataset
> [The Portal Project Teaching Database](http://figshare.com/articles/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459) is a simplified version of the
> [Portal Project Database](https://github.com/weecology/PortalData) designed for teaching. It provides a real world example of life-history, population, and ecological data, with sufficient complexity to teach many aspects of data analysis and management, but with many complexities removed to allow students to focus on the core ideas and skills being taught. The database is currently available in csv, json, and sqlite formats.
>
> The Portal Project Teaching Database's GitHub repository can be found at: [https://github.com/weecology/portal-teachingdb](https://github.com/weecology/portal-teachingdb),
> where suggested changes or additions to this dataset can be requested or contributed.
> This database is not designed for research as it intentionally removes some of the real-world complexities. The Python code used for converting the original database to this teaching version can be found in [create_portal_teach_dataset.py](https://github.com/weecology/portal-teachingdb/blob/master/create_portal_teaching_dataset.py).
