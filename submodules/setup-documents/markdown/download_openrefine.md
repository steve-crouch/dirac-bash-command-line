## Install OpenRefine ##

For this lesson you will need [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) (formerly GoogleRefine) and a web browser.
Download the most recent version of [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/download.html) for your operating system,
then follow the instructions below.

[OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) is a Java program that runs locally on your machine (i.e. you are not accessing a remote service on the Internet). Most recent versions of
OpenRefine for Windows and Mac come with embedded Java, in which case you do not need a separate Java installation.

Once it is running on your machine, you access it via your browser at the address [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333). No Internet connection is needed for this as the programme is running locally.

### Windows
- If you have Internet Explorer (or Edge) set as your default web browser, check that you have Firefox or Chrome installed and set either of them as your default browser. OpenRefine runs in your default browser, but may not run correctly in Internet Explorer. You can check how to set your browser as default for [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95417?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en-GB) or [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/make-firefox-your-default-browser).
- Unzip the downloaded file into a directory by right-clicking and selecting `Extract...`. Name that directory something like OpenRefine.
- Locate `openrefine.exe` in the extracted folder and launch OpenRefine by double-clicking on it. This will launch a command prompt window first.
- Wait for OpenRefine to launch in your default Web browser, which is where you will interact with the program. If this does not happen, head to [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) in your Web browser of choice.

### Mac

- Check that you have Firefox or Chrome browser installed and set as your default browser. You can check how to set your browser as default for [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95417?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en-GB) or [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/make-firefox-your-default-browser).
- Locate the downloaded `.dmg` file and Ctrl-click it. You may get the warning "macOS cannot verify the developer of “OpenRefine.app”. Are you sure you want to open it?" Click 'Yes'/'Open' to this.
- Drag `OpenRefine.app` into your Applications folder, and Ctrl-click to open it. You may get the warning "macOS cannot verify the developer of “OpenRefine.app”. Are you sure you want to open it?" Click 'Yes'/'Open' to this.
- Wait for OpenRefine to launch in your default Web browser, which is where you will interact with the program. If this does not happen, head to [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) in your Web browser of choice.

### Linux

- This requires Java to be installed on your computer. If you do not already have it, download [OpenJDK Java](https://openjdk.java.net/).
- Check that you have Firefox or Chrome browser installed and set as your default browser. You can check how to set your browser as default for [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95417?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en-GB) or [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/make-firefox-your-default-browser).
- Unzip the downloaded file into a directory. Go to this directory from terminal and type ./refine to start.
- Wait for OpenRefine to launch in your default Web browser, which is where you will interact with the program. If this does not happen, head to [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) in your Web browser of choice.
