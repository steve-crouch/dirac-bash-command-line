## Install LibreOffice ##

To interact with spreadsheets, you can use various software - for example Microsoft Excel,
LibreOffice, Gnumeric, OpenOffice.org, Google Spreadsheets. Commands may differ a bit between programs,
but the general ideas for thinking about spreadsheets are the same.

For this lesson, if you do not have a spreadsheet program already, you can use a free and open source tool
[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/)
as it can open Excel spreadsheets, which is the format of the data we will work with during the lesson
(also all examples used refer to Excel).
