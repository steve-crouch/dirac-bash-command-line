## Download Data for Shell Lesson ##

Type the following into the prompt that appears (pressing enter/return after each line):

~~~
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/Southampton-RSG-Training/shell-novice.git
~~~
{: .language-bash}

`cd` will move to your home directory, and `git clone` will download a copy of the materials.

Alternatively, if you have SSH authentication with GitHub enabled (if you don't know what this means don't worry, it is covered in the Git SWC course if you want to know more!) you can use the following:

~~~
$ cd
$ git clone git@github.com:Southampton-RSG-Training/shell-novice.git
~~~
{: .language-bash}

This should download all the content for the lesson to a new directory.
Please let the instructors know if you run into any problems.
