## PyCharm IDE
We use JetBrains's [PyCharm Python Integrated Development Environment](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm) for the course.
PyCharm can be downloaded from [the JetBrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download).
The Community edition is fine, though if you are developing software for the purpose of academic research you may
be eligible for a free license for the Professional edition which contains extra features.
