## Remote Desktop Client 

In this workshop we will be using remote desktops that come pre-configured with all the
resources you will need to complete the course. Before you start the course you will
receive and email with your login information. Prior to that you will need to download
the windows remote desktop client suitable for your operating system.

Link to Microsoft's website, please use the table to pick the link to the app appropriate to your system:
[Remote Desktop Clients](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-clients)

The remote desktop will be available to you for the time allocated to your workshop 
and potentially include some 'out of hours' time.

During the course we will have time dedicated to helping you install the software on 
your own computer so afterwards you can continue to use the skills you have learnt.

### The instructions to install the software on your own computer are provided below.
